I'm a scientist at heart, always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

My interest in science, research and sustainability led me to study **Bioprocesses Engineering**, which eventually led me to work as a **Research Scientist** while pursuing my **MSc. in Biochemical Engineering**, where I specialized in **Environmental Biotechnology** and **Wastewater Treatment**.

I’m a curious person with a strong passion for technology. In 2020, I discovered Python and Jupyter Notebooks, which sparked my interest in scientific computing and eventually led me to explore the fields of **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**.

By 2022 after finishing my master's degree and with the explosion of LLMs, I decided that I want to dive deep into ML and AI, so that I needed to learn to code and get deeper understanding of maths.

My current focus is on strengthening my mathematical foundations and mastering software engineering to achieve two key goals:

1. Conduct research in ML and explore its applications in biochemical engineering 🦠🤖, aiming to create a positive impact on society and the environment. 

2. Master the full lifecycle of Machine Learning systems (Full Stack ML). Rather than just building models in isolated environments, I want to develop end-to-end pipelines that are both scalable and resilient. My approach covers everything from data architecture and feature engineering to model training and versioning using MLOps, culminating in production deployment and continuous monitoring to ensure real business value.
