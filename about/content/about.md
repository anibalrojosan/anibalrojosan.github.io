I'm a scientist at heart, always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

My interest in science, research and sustainability led me to study **Bioprocesses Engineering**, which eventually led me to work as a **Research Scientist** while pursuing my **MSc. in Biochemical Engineering**, where I specialized in **Environmental Biotechnology** and **Wastewater Treatment**.

I'm a curious person and passionate about tech in general. In 2020 I discovered Python and Jupyter Notebooks and became interested in scientific computing, which eventually led to learn about the fields of **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**.

By 2022 after finishing my master's degree and with the explosion of LLMs, I decided that I want to dive deep into ML and AI, so that I needed to learn to code and get deeper understanding of maths.

My current focus is on upskill my abilities in mathematics and programming to conduct research in ML and explore its applications in biochemical engineering ðŸ¦ ðŸ¤–, aiming to create a positive impact on society and the environment.
