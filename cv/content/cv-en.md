## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE 

### INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER & SOFTWARE DEVELOPER | Personal Projects | Remote | FEBRUARY 2025 – PRESENT 

* End-to-end design and development of data products, applying software engineering principles to transform experimental models into deployable solutions. 
* Building robust and scalable applications using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), ensuring data integrity with Pydantic and code quality with automated testing suites (Pytest). 
* Implementation of automated MLOps workflows: orchestration of CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) and environment containerization (Docker) to accelerate model deployment in production. 

### MICROBIOLOGY ANALYST | Silob Chile | Valparaíso, Chile | JANUARY 2024 – FEBRUARY 2025 

* Rigorous execution of microbiological assays on samples of food, water, and liquid industrial waste (RILES) under NCh 17025 and ISO standards, ensuring traceability and quality of the generated data. 

### RESEARCHER | Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso | Valparaíso, Chile | MARCH 2020 – FEBRUARY 2023 

* Generation of heterogeneous datasets through the operation of sensor-instrumented reactors (time series) and discrete sampling, applying an A/B test design (with and without membrane). 
* Development of Pandas and NumPy scripts for cleaning, imputation, and structuring of raw data, replacing manual Excel workflows and reducing processing times. 
* Exploratory data analysis for the identification of non-linear patterns in pollutant removal (COD, N, P) and statistical validation of hypotheses on process efficiency. 
* Creation of scientific charts with Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate technical findings at international conferences (CHRIAM and Water Congress 2022), facilitating data-driven decision making. 

### PROJECT ENGINEER | Núcleo Biotecnológico Curauma | Valparaíso, Chile | JANUARY 2020 – MARCH 2020 

* Execution of on-site technical diagnostics (Barrio Bellavista) to evaluate water and energy consumption patterns. 
* Development of data-driven improvement plans to maximize profitability and reduce the environmental impact of each venue.
