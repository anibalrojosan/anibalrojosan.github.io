## Professional experience

### **Researcher**
**Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso**  
**March 2020 – February 2023**

- Investigated scientific literature on the use of **microalgae-bacteria High Rate Algal Pond (HRAP) reactors** for wastewater treatment and the use of **microfiltration membranes** to improve process performance.  
- Designed and operated **two continuous HRAP reactors**, one of which was coupled to a microfiltration membrane.  
- Evaluated both technologies under different workloads for **COD removal** and **nutrient capture (N and P)** in wastewater.  
- Determined **biomass characteristics** and analyzed performance metrics.  
- Analyzed and visualized data using **Microsoft Excel** and **Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** to identify patterns, optimize processes, and evaluate scalability — enabling sustainable decision-making.  
- Developed a **novel technology** that achieved higher load capacity and compact reactor design compared to traditional systems.  
- Presented results at scientific conferences in **Spanish (CRHIAM Congress 2022)** and **English (Water Congress 2022)**, strengthening skills in **scientific communication and storytelling**.

### **Project Engineer**
**Núcleo Biotecnológico Curauma**  
**January 2020 – March 2020**

- Provided **on-site technical support** to commercial establishments in Barrio Bellavista, Santiago, aiming to improve **energy efficiency** and **water consumption**.  
- Prepared comprehensive technical reports for each establishment, proposing **economic and sustainability improvements**.
